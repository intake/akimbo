Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install ``awkward-pandas`` you will need both ``awkward`` and
``pandas``. The strict requirements are:

- ``awkward >=2.0.0``
- ``pandas >=1.2``

Whether you install from PyPI or conda-forge, these requirements will
be enforced.

From PyPI

The first official release of awkward-pandas is planned for
December 2022. Since an official release does not yet exist, we
recommend installing from the ``HEAD`` of the git repository:

.. code::

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/intake/awkward-pandas@main


Alpha releases can also be installed from PyPI:

.. code::

   $ pip install awkward-pandas
